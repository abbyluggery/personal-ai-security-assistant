## 📅 WEEKLY WORKFLOW CYCLE

### **Sunday Evening (Week Planning - 30 minutes)**

**Step 1: Plan Next Week's Meals**

**Process:**
1. Open 6-week meal rotation calendar
2. Identify which week in rotation (Week 1-6)
3. Assign meals to each day of upcoming week
4. Verify no repeats within 42-day window

**Requirements per day:**
- Breakfast (optional - can be same daily)
- Lunch (required)
- Dinner (required)
- Snacks (as needed)

**Constraints:**
- Weeknight dinners: ≤30 minutes final prep (after Sunday prep)
- Weekend dinners: ≤60 minutes total time
- All meals: <500mg sodium, diabetic-friendly, high protein
- Portions: Scale all recipes for 5 people

**Output:** 7-day meal plan with specific recipes assigned

---

**Step 2: Generate Shopping List from Meal Plan**

**Process:**
1. Extract all ingredients from assigned recipes
2. Scale quantities for 5 servings
3. Check pantry/fridge inventory
4. Subtract on-hand ingredients
5. Group remaining ingredients by store section
6. Add pet food if monthly restock due

**Store Section Organization (Publix-Specific):**
```
Shopping List Structure:
├── PROTEINS (Meat, Poultry, Seafood)
├── PRODUCE (Vegetables, Fruits)
├── DAIRY/EGGS (Milk, Cheese, Yogurt, Eggs)
├── PANTRY (Canned goods, Grains, Spices, Oils)
├── FROZEN (Vegetables, Prepared items)
├── BAKERY (Bread, Tortillas)
└── PET FOOD (5 cats, 1 dog - monthly)
```

**Budget Calculation:**
- Low estimate: $240
- High estimate: $300
- Typical weekly spend target: $270

**Output:** Organized shopping list with quantities and budget range

---

### **Monday (Coupon Day - 15 minutes)**

**Step 3: Match Coupons to Shopping List**

**Digital Coupon Sources (Check in Order):**

**1. Southern Savers (Primary Source)**
- Website: southernsavers.com
- Check: Monday morning (new ads posted)
- What to look for:
  - Publix weekly ad breakdown
  - BOGO deals highlighted
  - Manufacturer coupon matchups
  - Digital coupon stacks

**Action:** Cross-reference shopping list with this week's deals
- Highlight items on sale
- Note BOGO opportunities
- Adjust meal plan if needed for significant savings

---

**2. Publix Digital Coupons**
- Platform: Publix app or website
- Action: Load ALL relevant coupons to account
- Categories to check:
  - Proteins (chicken, beef, pork, seafood)
  - Produce
  - Dairy
  - Pantry staples
  - Pet food (if monthly restock)

**Process:**
1. Open Publix app
2. Go to "Coupons" section
3. Search for items on shopping list
4. Click "Load to Card" for each match
5. Coupons auto-apply at checkout

---

**3. Ibotta Offers**
- Platform: Ibotta app
- Action: Pre-load offers BEFORE shopping
- Focus on:
  - Any items on shopping list
  - Bonus categories (e.g., "Buy 5 produce items, get $2")
  - Staple items you always buy

**Important:** Must scan receipt within 48 hours of purchase!

---

**4. Review BOGO Deals**

**Florida BOGO Rules:**
- Must purchase BOTH items to get deal
- Each item rings up at 50% off
- Can use manufacturer coupons on BOTH items

**Strategy:**
1. Check which shopping list items have BOGO this week
2. Evaluate if you need/can store 2 of the item
3. If yes: Add to "Priority Purchase" list
4. If no: Skip unless freezable and price is exceptional

**Example BOGO Maximization:**
```
Item: Chicken breasts (regular $8.99/lb)
BOGO: Buy 2, each $4.50/lb
Manufacturer coupon: $1 off any chicken
Publix digital coupon: $0.50 off chicken

Calculation:
2 lbs @ $4.50 = $9.00
- Manufacturer coupon (×2): -$2.00
- Digital coupon: -$0.50
Final: $6.50 for 2 lbs ($3.25/lb vs. $8.99/lb)
Savings: $11.48 (63% off)
```

**Output:** Coupon-matched shopping list with expected savings

PORK CHOPS:
Regular: $5.99/lb × 2 lbs = $11.98
Sale price: $3.99/lb × 2 lbs = $7.98

CANNED TOMATOES:
Regular: $1.29 × 2 cans = $2.58

**Step 4: Adjust Meal Plan for Maximum Savings (Optional)**

## 💰 SAVINGS OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### **BOGO Maximization**

**Florida BOGO Rules Reminder:**
- Must buy both items
- Each rings at 50% off
- Can use coupons on BOTH items

**Stacking Example:**
```
Item: Pasta sauce (BOGO)
Regular: $3.49 each
BOGO: $1.75 each × 2 = $3.50

Coupons available:
- Manufacturer: $0.75 off 1
- Publix digital: $0.50 off 1
- Ibotta: $0.25 back on 1

Strategy:
Buy 2 jars
Use manufacturer coupon on each: $0.75 × 2 = -$1.50
Use digital coupon on one: -$0.50
Ibotta on one: -$0.25

Final: $3.50 - $1.50 - $0.50 = $1.50 + get $0.25 back
TOTAL: $1.25 for 2 jars
Regular would be: $6.98
SAVINGS: $5.73 (82%)
```

**Best BOGO Items to Stock:**
- Non-perishables (canned goods, pasta, sauce)
- Frozen proteins (freeze for future)
- Pantry staples (oils, spices, baking)

---

### **Yellow Sticker Strategy**

**What are yellow stickers?**
- Manager markdowns on items nearing sell-by date
- Typically 30-50% off
- Safe to use if consumed soon or frozen

**When to find them:**
- Early morning (6-8 AM): Previous day's markdowns
- Late afternoon (4-6 PM): Today's markdowns
- Evening (after 7 PM): Final markdowns

**What to buy:**
- Proteins: Freeze immediately if not using within 2 days
- Produce: Use within 2-3 days
- Bakery: Freeze bread/buns
- Dairy: Check dates carefully

**What to avoid:**
- Items past sell-by date
- Items with off smell/appearance
- Dairy expiring next day (unless using immediately)

---

### **Manager's Special Strategy**

**What are manager's specials?**
- Not marked down yet, but special pricing
- Often unadvertised
- Found throughout store

**Where to look:**
- Meat department (ask butcher)
- Produce section (bulk deals)
- Bakery (day-old section)
- End caps (clearance items)

**When to buy:**
- Price is 40%+ off regular
- Can use immediately or freeze
- Matches meal plan or can adjust plan

---

### **After 7 PM Bakery Discount**

**Automatic 50% off stickers:**
- Applied to bakery items after 7 PM
- Fresh bread, rolls, bagels, muffins
- Cookies, cakes (if not custom)

**Strategy:**
- Shop after 7 PM on Saturdays
- Buy bread/buns for week
- Freeze extras
- Buy treats at half price

**Best buys:**
- Sandwich bread (freeze half)
- Hamburger/hot dog buns (freeze)
- Bagels (freeze)
- Tortillas (don't freeze well, buy only what you'll use)

---

### **Monthly Pet Food Strategy**

**Budget:** $80-105/month for 6 pets (5 cats, 1 dog)

**Optimization:**
1. Buy during BOGO weeks only
2. Stock up for 2-3 months when on sale
3. Use manufacturer coupons (often available)
4. Check Ibotta for pet food offers
5. Buy largest bags if storage allows (better per-pound price)

**Never compromise on:**
- Food quality for price
- Veterinary recommendations
- Known allergies/sensitivities
