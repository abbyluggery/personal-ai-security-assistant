## 🎯 SHOPPING STRATEGY FOR STAPLES

### **When to Restock:**
- **Weekly:** Items consumed regularly (milk, eggs, bread, produce)
- **Bi-weekly:** Items consumed moderately (cheese, yogurt, some canned goods)
- **Monthly:** Items consumed slowly (spices, baking supplies, pet food during BOGO)
- **As needed:** Items used rarely (specialty ingredients, seasonal items)

### **Budget Allocation:**
- **Weekly groceries:** $240-300 includes some staple replenishment
- **Monthly pet food:** $80-105 (separate from grocery budget)
- **Stockpile during sales:** BOGO deals on non-perishables

### **Storage Tips:**
- **Pantry:** Cool, dry, dark place
- **Refrigerator:** 35-38°F, organize by expiration dates
- **Freezer:** 0°F, label everything with date
- **First In, First Out (FIFO):** Rotate stock, use oldest first
