## 🎯 CATEGORY 1: JARVIS BUILD UPDATES

### **Post #1: Project Announcement**
```
Building JARVIS: a personal AI assistant designed for high-risk users with compound vulnerabilities (neurodivergent + safety concerns). 

Combining dual-PIN anti-coercion architecture with Salesforce integration for job search automation. Because technology should protect its most vulnerable users.

#AIforGood #Salesforce #PersonalAI
```

**When to use:** First post introducing your project  
**Tone:** Professional + mission-driven

---

### **Post #2: Technical Challenge**
```
Fascinating challenge: How do you design an AI assistant that can operate under coercion while secretly protecting the user?

Answer: Structural security. Assume jailbreaks will succeed, isolate critical functions at system level. Think "panic room for AI."

Building JARVIS taught me that security isn't about preventing all attacks—it's about containing damage when they succeed.

#AISecurit #TechDesign
```

**When to use:** After working on security architecture  
**Tone:** Technical + insightful

---

### **Post #3: Memory Architecture**
```
Knowledge graph memory is exploding right now (Anthropic's MCP, Graphiti, Zep all launched in 2024). 

I'm implementing temporal memory in JARVIS with a twist: optimized for neurodivergent users. Time-blindness? Energy tracking? Context switching? Built in from the start.

Accessibility isn't an add-on. It's a design principle.

#AI #Accessibility #Neurodiversity
```

**When to use:** After reading KG memory research  
**Tone:** Informed + inclusive

---

### **Post #4: Personal Motivation**
```
Why am I building JARVIS? 

Because I needed it. Because survivors need technology they can trust. Because neurodivergent professionals deserve AI that understands their brain works differently.

Sometimes the best solutions come from lived experience.

#BuiltByUsers #PersonalAI
```

**When to use:** When feeling connected to mission  
**Tone:** Personal + authentic

---

## 🎓 CATEGORY 2: SALESFORCE LEARNING

### **Post #5: Exam Progress**
```
90% pass rate on Salesforce Admin practice exams. Dec 30 is the day.

Most surprising part? Agentforce AI testing frameworks. Enterprise AI testing strategies apply beautifully to personal AI projects. Bidirectional learning at its best.

#Salesforce #AdminCert #LifelongLearning
```

**When to use:** This week (before exam)  
**Tone:** Confident + progress-focused

---

### **Post #6: Bridge Technologist Positioning**
```
Financial services compliance + Salesforce development + AI security = Bridge Technologist.

I translate between business requirements and technical implementation. Between regulated industries and cutting-edge AI. Between "what we need" and "how we build it."

This intersection is where I thrive.

#Salesforce #FinancialServices #AI
```

**When to use:** When positioning for job applications  
**Tone:** Professional + value proposition

---

### **Post #7: Agentforce Insight**
```
Agentforce testing: regression suites for AI behavior, quality gates for deployment, performance benchmarks.

Realized this applies beyond Salesforce. Every personal AI assistant needs these same guardrails.

Enterprise best practices scale down beautifully.

#Salesforce #Agentforce #AITesting
```

**When to use:** After studying Agentforce  
**Tone:** Technical insight

---

## 🔐 CATEGORY 3: SECURITY RESEARCH

### **Post #8: Jailbreak Research**
```
TIL: Jailbreak success rates against LLMs range from 7% to 90% depending on technique.

Prompt engineering alone won't cut it. We need system-level defenses that assume the LLM will eventually be compromised.

Defense in depth isn't optional—it's survival.

#AISecurit #LLM #CyberSecurity
```

**When to use:** After reading security research  
**Tone:** Educational + authoritative

---

### **Post #9: Plausible Deniability**
```
Plausible deniability has existed in encryption since the 1990s (shoutout to Bunnie Huang's PDDB).

But no one's applied it to AI assistant BEHAVIOR. What if your AI could appear cooperative under coercion while secretly protecting you?

That's the problem JARVIS solves.

#AISecurit #Innovation
```

**When to use:** After prior art research  
**Tone:** Research-informed + novel contribution

---

### **Post #10: Honeypot Detection**
```
Designing anti-coercion systems means thinking like an attacker.

If an AI is compromised by another AI (not a human), response time drops below 3 seconds. Humans need 5-10 seconds to read injection prompts.

Honeypot queries can detect AI attackers. It's an arms race, but we're keeping up.

#AISecurit #ThreatModeling
```

**When to use:** When working on security features  
**Tone:** Technical + clever

---

## 💼 CATEGORY 4: JOB SEARCH / CAREER

### **Post #11: Job Search Status**
```
Actively seeking: Salesforce Administrator, Solutions Architect, or Technical Business Analyst roles.

What I bring: 2.5 years Salesforce at Macquarie Capital (99% data integrity), 10 years financial services, cutting-edge AI specialization (Agentblazer Champion, Ranger rank).

Remote or Florida-based. Let's talk.

#Salesforce #JobSearch #Hiring
```

**When to use:** Every 2-3 weeks  
**Tone:** Professional + available

---

### **Post #12: Interview Milestone**
```
Second-round interview with ODP Business Solutions yesterday. 

Whether I get the role or not, getting to the second round means I'm on the right track. Progress is progress.

Onward.

#JobSearch #GrowthMindset
```

**When to use:** After interviews  
**Tone:** Resilient + authentic

---

### **Post #13: Portfolio Showcase**
```
My technical portfolio: 35,000+ lines of production code across 5 applications.

JARVIS (personal AI), SafeHaven (DV survivor app), NeuroThrive (wellness PWA), plus Salesforce backends with 32 custom objects and 95 Apex classes.

Not bad for someone who's "just" a Salesforce admin.

#TechnicalPortfolio #Salesforce #Developer
```

**When to use:** When showcasing work  
**Tone:** Proud + accomplished

---

## 🧠 CATEGORY 5: NEURODIVERGENT ADVOCACY

### **Post #14: ADHD in Tech**
```
ADHD isn't a bug in my code—it's a feature in my design process.

Hyperfocus = deep technical dives. Pattern recognition = system architecture. Creative problem-solving = innovative solutions.

Neurodivergent professionals don't need to be "fixed." We need environments that let us thrive.

#Neurodiversity #ADHD #TechCareers
```

**When to use:** When feeling confident about neurodivergence  
**Tone:** Empowering + advocacy

---

### **Post #15: Burnout Management**
```
Managing burnout while job searching while building JARVIS while studying for Salesforce cert?

Daily energy tracking. Non-negotiable rest. Low-burden content strategy (repurpose conversations, not create new).

Sustainable productivity > hustle culture.

#BurnoutPrevention #SelfCare #ADHD
```

**When to use:** When discussing work-life balance  
**Tone:** Honest + practical

---

## 🎉 CATEGORY 6: WINS & MILESTONES

### **Post #16: Certification Progress**
```
11 days until Salesforce Admin exam. 

Started with 60% pass rate on practice tests. Now at 90%.

Growth isn't always linear, but it's always possible.

#Salesforce #AdminCert #Progress
```

**When to use:** This week  
**Tone:** Motivational

---

### **Post #17: Technical Achievement**
```
Just implemented temporal knowledge graph memory in JARVIS using Anthropic's MCP framework.

Entities, relationships, observations—all time-aware. The AI remembers not just WHAT you said, but WHEN and WHY it mattered.

Persistent memory changes everything.

#AI #TechnicalWin #BuildInPublic
```

**When to use:** After major technical milestone  
**Tone:** Excited + technical

---

### **Post #18: Community Impact**
```
The best part of building SafeHaven isn't the code—it's knowing it might help someone escape abuse.

Technology can be a weapon or a shield. I choose shield.

#TechForGood #DomesticViolence #SafetyTech
```

**When to use:** When reflecting on impact  
**Tone:** Mission-driven + heartfelt

---

## 🔬 CATEGORY 7: RESEARCH & LEARNING

### **Post #19: Prior Art Research**
```
Spent today researching prior art for JARVIS. 

Knowledge graph memory? Very active research (Anthropic MCP, Graphiti, Zep all 2024). Plausible deniability? Dates to 1990s encryption (Bunnie Huang's PDDB).

My contribution: Applying these to AI assistants for high-risk neurodivergent users. Novel synthesis matters.

#Research #AI #Innovation
```

**When to use:** After completing research  
**Tone:** Academic + positioned

---

### **Post #20: White Paper Plans**
```
Considering writing a white paper: "Anti-Coercion Architecture for Personal AI Assistants."

Plausible deniability for AI behavior (not just data). Structural security assuming jailbreaks succeed. Design for compound vulnerability.

ArXiv first, then maybe DEF CON. Let's see where this goes.

#Research #AISecurit #AcademicWriting

**When to use:** When committing to white paper  
**Tone:** Ambitious + thoughtful
