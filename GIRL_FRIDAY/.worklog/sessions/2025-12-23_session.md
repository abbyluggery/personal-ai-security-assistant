## Topics Discussed (In Order)

### 1. Job Parsing Difficulty (17:33 UTC)
- **Issue:** Job parsing across 8 APIs proving difficult
- **Root Cause:** Monolithic JobPostingAnalyzer.cls trying to do everything
- **Solution Proposed:** Multi-agent architecture with specialist agents + subagents
- **Documentation Created:** `job-parsing-agent-architecture.md`

### 2. Resume Generation Integration (17:40 UTC)
- **Issue:** Missing from multi-agent plan
- **Abby's Observation:** "I don't see resume generation covered"
- **Solution:** Resume Coordinator Agent with 3 subagents
- **Documentation Created:** `resume-generation-agent-architecture.md`

### 3. Content Automation (17:45 UTC)
- **Question:** Can agents automate blog/LinkedIn posts?
- **Answer:** YES - using data mining + content generation agents
- **Documentation Created:** `content-automation-agent-architecture.md`

### 4. Jobs_Profile__c Status (17:50 UTC)
- **Update:** Object already created! ✅
- **Fields:** 13 total (User__c, Min_Salary__c, Max_Salary__c, etc.)
- **Action Needed:** Verify in Salesforce org

### 5. Girl Friday Work Tracker Request (17:52 UTC)
- **Need:** Keep track of bouncing conversations

### 7. Date/Time Stamp Issue (17:55 UTC)
- **Problem:** Not using system timestamps consistently
- **Abby's Question:** "Can you read date/time from CPU?"
- **Answer:** YES! `date` command available
- **Solution:** Create CLAUDE.md with timestamp automation rules

---

## Decisions Made

### ✅ CONFIRMED DECISIONS
1. **Priority Order (Abby's Direction):**
   - P0: Girl Friday work tracker (IMMEDIATE)
   - P1: Job parsing improvements
   - P2: Resume automation
   - P3: LinkedIn/Blog posts (affects job search)
   - P4: Social media automation (journal) - LAST

2. **Work Tracker Approach:**
   - Start with ROADMAP.md (simple, immediate)
   - Add Archon Manager later (powerful, requires setup)

3. **Social Media Strategy:**
   - Use Late API for unified posting ($99/month)
   - Draft generation + manual approval for compliance
   - Pinterest priority (already integrated?)

4. **Timestamp Standardization:**
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ`
   - Use `date` command consistently
   - Add to all file headers, ROADMAP updates, session logs

### 🔄 PENDING DECISIONS
- [ ] When to install Archon Manager?
- [ ] Which agent to build first (SalaryExtraction vs Resume Coordinator)?
- [ ] Social media approval level (full auto vs draft review)?

- **Future:** Archon Manager MCP (powerful, requires setup)
- **Features Needed:**
  - Task tracking with priorities (P0/P1/P2)
  - Session logs (conversation history)
  - Carry forward critical details
  - ADHD-friendly (visual checkboxes, one task at a time)

### Known Issues
1. **JobPostingAnalyzer.cls** - Monolithic, needs breaking into 4 specialist agents
2. **Salary Parsing** - Inconsistent across APIs ("$85k-$95k", "$50/hr", "Competitive")
3. **Duplicate Jobs** - Same job from RemoteOK, Adzuna, JSearch → 3 records
4. **Experience Requirements** - Parsing "5+ years", "10+ years" formats
5. **Location Standardization** - "Remote, USA" vs "100% Remote (US only)" vs "Hybrid - NY"
6. **Jobs_Profile__c Integration** - Created but not used by JobPostingAnalyzer yet

### Conversation Patterns Observed
1. **Brain Bouncing:** Abby switches topics mid-conversation (this is NORMAL and GOOD)
2. **Detail Loss Risk:** Small details get lost when context compacts (e.g., Jobs_Profile__c field count)
3. **Decision Fatigue:** Too many options = paralysis (keep to 1-3 choices max)
4. **Visual Progress:** Checkboxes provide dopamine (✅ = win!)
5. **Time Blindness:** Timestamps help with accountability
6. **Context Switching:** Needs external memory (session logs, carry forward file)

## Context for Next Session

**Where We Left Off:**
- Abby wants Girl Friday work tracker FIRST (highest priority)
- Decided on ROADMAP.md approach (simple, immediate)
- Archon Manager is future addition (more powerful)
- Job parsing improvements are P1 (after work tracker)
- LinkedIn/Blog posts are P3 (affect job search)
- Social media (journal) is LAST

**Abby's Energy:**
- Currently engaged and productive
- Brain bouncing around topics (normal pattern)
- Making clear decisions on priorities
- Excited about tracking system

**Next Action:**
When we resume, I should:
1. Get system timestamp
2. Read this session log
3. Read carry_forward.md (once created)
4. Read ROADMAP.md (once created)
5. Ask Abby: "Should we create ROADMAP.md first or answer Archon Manager questions?"

---

This was a highly productive session! We covered:
- Multi-agent architecture for job parsing
- Resume generation integration
- Content automation design
- Girl Friday research (found 6 Claude Skills)
